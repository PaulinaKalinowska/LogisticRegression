# LogisticRegression

Another machine learning example: Using the LogisticRegression from Scikit-learn library, I predict if the flat is located in the center basing on other parameters from gratka's adverts. 

Files:
-> 'Flats_LogisticRegression.ipynb'- my Python code;
-> 'gratkapl-centrenrm.csv'- used data
